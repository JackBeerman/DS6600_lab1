The local chapter of [Meals on Wheels](https://www.cvillemeals.org/) worked with some UVA computer science students and volunteers from [WillowTree Apps](https://www.willowtreeapps.com/), who built them a [web portal for volunteers](https://www.cvillemeals.org/portal) to sign up for shifts and a [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meals-on-wheels-ca/id1620046443) that shows volunteers their driving routes with GPS mapping. The portal and app have been extremely useful for the local Meals on Wheels chapter, but unfortunately, the portal and app were built only for the Charlottesville chapter and is not usable by any other Meals on Wheels chapter at present. You've been asked to help every other Meals on Wheels chapter to benefit from these products by generalizing the code, and then making it available for free to any chapter that wants to use the portal and app. Every chapter has their own database of volunteers and clients, necessitating a large amount of storage that must also be accessible through an internet connection.

The DOLI stored this data in an Excel file with horrible formatting: the column headers are given vague names, text has misspelling throughout the file (you see locations such as \"Rochmond\" and \"Norflok\"), data types are inconsistent within columns (sometimes a `$` is included with the wage amounts, sometimes `$` is excluded), and so on. They've asked you to clean the data and generate a report that lists the average claim of wage theft and a frequency table of the number of claims by locality.

An international NGO called [Save the Children](https://www.savethechildren.org/) provides housing, food, medical care, and other assistance to individuals who have been displaced from their homes by conflict or natural disasters. But a major problem is that these displacement events can happen suddenly, without giving Save the Children any time to mobilize. Major migration events are more likely when the infrastructure and buildings in a city or town have been destroyed. Save the Children have asked you to build a predictive model that can detect from [land-satellite images](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-8) the extent of infrastructure damage in an area of interest and that can be deployed by several different individuals working for Save the Children.
